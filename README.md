# BERT-Text-Classification

Using pre-trained models of BERT from https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/2 and Quora Insincere Quesstions Classifications Dataset (https://archive.org/download/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow-train.csv/train.csv.zip) for classification of text based on sentiment understanding of underlying quora questions. The model is fine-tuned by introducing Adam optimizer and BinaryCrossentropy for loss analysis.
